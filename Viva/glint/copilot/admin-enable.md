# Administrator enablement for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Viva Glint

Admins enable Microsoft 365 Copilot in Viva Glint. Microsoft privacy policies prohibit Copilot in Viva Glint from being enabled by default for any User Roles. 

Prerequisites to enabling Microsoft 365 Copilot in Viva Glint:
- You have at least one Recurring or Ad hoc survey administered or closed on the Viva Glint platform
- Your dashboard default language is set to English
- View Comments is enabled on the Reporting tab in Program Summary

Assign yourself and other leaders using Copilot in Viva Glint to a new [User Role](/viva/glint/setup/set-up-user-roles). The new User Role must have access to the Comments Report. Add that User Role to the survey [**Reporting** page](/viva/glint/setup/reporting-setup) in **Program Summary**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Manager role has Comments Report permission enabled as a default setting.

## Grant Comments Report permission

1. From your admin dashboard, select the **configuration (cogwheel)** symbol.
1.	In the **Employees** section, select **User Roles**.
1.	Select the User Role to provide Comments report access. In this example, Company Admin is chosen.

## Grant Comments Reports access

Navigate to the **Reporting** section in **Program Summary**. This step allows users enabled for the Comment Reports to access the report.

### Ramp up to full utilization

Copilot in Viva Glint gives you the flexibility to roll out to one or many user roles. Consider what approach is right for your organization. Viva Glint suggests this best practice for ramping to a full rollout:

1. **Admin release:** By default, Copilot in Viva Glint is available to the Admin User Role. You may decide that for the first deployment you don't want to provide access beyond this group. This initial release can be a way to first test and better understand the functionality. Admins can also use this time to test the Copilot functionality for previously closed surveys before using it for an upcoming cycle. 
1.  **Selective deployment:** You may decide to deploy to a group beyond the admins but still not your entire eligible population. Consider which groups make sense for you. Perhaps these groups are your extended HRBP team or senior leaders who have large amounts of comments. As long as the group you're granting access to is part of a set User Role group, they can have access.
1.  **Full deployment:** Deploying to all eligible users is the highest level of deployment. These users include all roles who have results access. Even with this deployment, some leaders may not be able to use Copilot if their comments and respondents don't meet your set thresholds. For those teams that have fewer comments, Copilot may be less critical, as often these leaders can read through verbatims quickly.

### Process

1. From your admin dashboard, select the **Configuration** symbol.
2.	In the **Surveys** section, select **Survey Programs**.
3.	**Select the closed Recurring or Ad hoc program** for which you want to grant access.
4.	In **Program Summary**, select **Reporting**.

5. In **Program Roles**, select the User Role to enable with Copilot in Viva Glint. *In this example, the customized role is 'VI.'*

## Get the most from Copilot in Viva Glint

Use these guidelines to maximize what Copilot can summarize: 

### Enable comments

Enabling comments on quantitative items allows for more detailed feedback and context, enhancing the data's richness and usefulness for summarization. This approach provides a more comprehensive view of feedback, even on single-item indices. This practice, in turn, allows Copilot to generate more accurate and insightful summaries.

### Bring in relevant filter attributes

Copilot in Viva Glint uses HRIS or demographic attributes that are imported to Viva Glint to filter data. The use of attributes allows for targeted insights based on specific and impactful employee filters. Enable filter attributes that are important for the user roles interacting with Copilot. 

### Use these quick tips

- Need help with writing prompts? [Use these tips to get started writing prompts for Copilot in Viva Glint](/viva/glint/setup/copilot-manager-quick-guide?branch=main#quick-tips-for-copilot-prompts).

### Ask open-ended questions

Open-ended survey items are valuable for capturing a wide range of feedback. Open-ended items allow respondents to freely express their thoughts on topics that aren't covered by the survey items. Comment boxes provide a space for any top-of-mind concerns or suggestions. Comments are typically detailed and offer rich data  for Copilot to generate comprehensive summaries. Comment summarization may reveal insights not apparent from quantitative data alone.

### Use Recurring and Ad Hoc programs

At this time, Copilot in Viva Glint is unable to tap into Always-On and Employee Lifecycle programs. To maximize your ability to use Copilot in Viva Glint, use Recurring program setup for ongoing topics (for example, Engagement) and Ad Hoc for one-off topics (for example, Change Management).
