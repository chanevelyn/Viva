# Use Viva Glint's Multi-attribute export

Microsoft Viva Glint Administrators can deep dive into survey scores and view results of combinations of up to three attributes. The Multi-attribute export is available for both Engagement-type surveys and Employee Lifecycle surveys. 

## Access the Multi-attribute export

Only Viva Glint Admins can access this export.

1. Select **Reports** from the Viva Glint Dashboard.
2. In the **Survey programs** list on the left, select a survey.
3. Select the **Multi-attribute export** tile.
4. Depending on the survey type, use the following information to export results:
   - [Recurring or Ad Hoc surveys](#export-results-for-recurring-and-ad-hoc-surveys)
   - [Always-On and Employee Lifecycle surveys](#export-results-for-always-on-and-employee-lifecycle-surveys)

## Export results for Recurring and Ad Hoc surveys

In the Multi-attribute export dialog that appears:

1. Confirm that the **Survey program** displayed is the survey initially selected from the **Survey programs** list.
2. Select a survey cycle from the **Program cycle** dropdown menu.
3. In the Attributes field, select an attribute. The number of unique attribute values displays next to the selected attribute.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When an attribute has zero values, a warning message appears. Select attributes that have at least one value.
   
4. To add up to three total attributes, use the **+ Add an attribute** option and select more attributes.
